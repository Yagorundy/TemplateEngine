# TemplateEngine
FMI Introduction to Programming (practicum) - solution to course project #4 (Template engine)


This is a simple template engine. You input the paths to the template file and the data file and then the engine generates documents based on the template using the data provided. Check out the project criterias [here](Template%20engine.pdf) to get familiar with the concept.

This engine:
- can replace variables with values
- supports single and nested loops
- has logic that handles empty spaces between loop tags so the output document looks good

You can find example template and data files in the `data` directory.
